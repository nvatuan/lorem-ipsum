  Problem#0007: Greedy is Good Greedy is Great
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
Avaritia is a greedy theif. Nothing is wrong with being greedy if you are ALREADY A THEIF.
He tries to steal as many valuable items as he can. In his eyes, a $2 book is wayy cheaper than
a $3 book. Yes, he would take a $3 book instead of a $2 book everytime.

Now, he has broken into a bank. This bank has 4 kinds of coins: $1, $5, $10 and $20
He wants to steal as many as he can but he has made a big mistake, his bag can only contain an
amount of coins!! Notice that any coin has the same weight.
Given the amount of coins Avaritia can put in his bag. 
Given the amount of $1 coins, $5 coins, $10 coins, $20 coins the bank has.
Can you calculate the highest value he can steal?
--[I/O FORMAT: standard]--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
INPUT:
First line, a positive integer is the amount of coins Avaritia can carry
Second line, 4 positive numbers, with each of them being the number of:
             $1 coins, $5 coins, $10 coins, $20 coins that the bank has.
Any INPUT number is greater than 0 and not greater than 10**18. Result is not greater than 10**18
OUTPUT:
One integer number, the highest value he can steal. Just the integer, don't output the dollar sign

INPUT:

5 4 3 2
OUTPUT:
70

This problem is a classic problem with a little twist that is solved using Greedy Algorithm.
Greedy Algorithm (or Thuat toan Tham Lam) is a way to solve problems.
A solution to a problem has multiple steps. And solving something Greedily means each step, you
make the most optimal choice that (you currently see) or (is currently available).

Let's say, you are selling something to someone. To be able to make profit, you will sell it as
high as you can, right? If the buyer complains, you will have 2 choices: Raise it or lower it.
If you raise the price, the buyer might leave and not buy it. So you will have to lower the price.
As you can see here, if you sell the item low price, then the buyer complains and you have to
lower it more. You will lose profit. So the best thing you can do is start selling it high price.

Other example: When you are preparing the school bag, what would you do if you forget which subject
tomorrow has? You can bring all of the books and notebooks, but a Greedy solution is: You don't
have to bring the subjects you already learned this week. Well, if tomorrow is Monday then...

Greedy Algorithm does not always work, as you might have realized. But it is still a fanstatic algo
