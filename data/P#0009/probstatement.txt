  Problem#0009: Mass Opinion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
Channel14 is a popular website that posts news articles and reviews.

Channel14 earns money from clicks and views. And article that has the most views (or clicks), 
its writer will also earns the most. This means, a user doesn't have to read the article,
they just have to click on an article. This leads to making shocking, absurd headlines that make
people curious enough to click on it. This phenomenon is called "click-baiting".

Because of this, a writer doesn't need to write the actual article! They only have to write
the Title! So to combat against this, Channel14 made a rating system to filter its articles.
A reader can vote a news article GOOD/BAD based on how they feel about it. And Channel14 will
display better articles on the top and worse articles down the bottom.
Article A is better than Article B if Article A has its GOOD:BAD ratio higher than B's.
The system guarantees there are NO 2 ARTICLES with THE SAME GOOD:BAD ratio NOR THE SAME TITLE.

You are given an amount of articles. Each article has a title, number of ratings, and the rating
(1 is GOOD, -1 is BAD). Your task is to output all of the articles' title following the order of
descending GOOD:BAD ratio.
--[I/O FORMAT: standard]--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
INPUT:
First line, a positive integer N, is the amount of articles (1 <= N <= 1000)
The next N lines, each line has the title of each of N article (0 < Title length <= 1000)
After that, there are N lines, i-th line is a number sequence, is the ratings of the i-th article:
   The first number is the number of ratings, is a positive integer R (1 <= R <= 1000)
   Then, there are R integers are either 1 or -1, represent GOOD or BAD
OUTPUT:
N lines, each line contains title of an articles. OUTPUT follows descending GOOD:BAD ratio order.
--[EXAMPLE]-------------------------------|--[EXPLANATION]----------------------------------------|
INPUT:                                    |  There are 3 articles:
3                                         |  "ABC" is the 1st article
ABC                                       |  "Chang trai ngheo vuot kho" is the 2nd article
Chang trai ngheo vuot kho                 |  "Vu gian lan thi cu, sua diem tai Son La" is the 3rd
Vu gian lan thi cu, sua diem tai Son La   |  
3 1 -1 -1                                 |  Rating of the First article, has 1 GOOD and 2 BAD 
5 1 1 1 1 -1                              |  Rating of the Second article has 4 GOOD and 1 BAD
10 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1                    |  Rating of the Third article has 10 GOOD and 0 BAD
OUTPUT:                                   |  First article  has GOOD:BAD ratio is 33.33%
Vu gian lan thi cu, sua diem tai Son La   |  Second article has GOOD:BAD ratio is 80%
Chang trai ngheo vuot kho                 |  Third article  has GOOD:BAD ratio is 100%
ABC                                       |  
                                          |  Then, the order of output is: 3rd -> 2nd -> 1st
--[CONSTRAINTS]---------------------------|  (because 100% > 80% > 33.33%)
Time limit: 1 second                      |  (remember INPUT guarantees there are no 2 articles
Memory limit: Size of your RAM            |  with the same ratio)
